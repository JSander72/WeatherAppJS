set -o allexport; source /<path_to_the_directory_of_.env_file>/.env; set +o allexport

The above configuration will loop through all the environment variables you added to the .env file and set them on the Linux machine.

To save the configuration, press esc, then type :wq and press enter as you did previously.

To confirm that the configuration took effect and your environment variables have been set, log out of your current shell session, log back in and then run:

$ printenv 

After running the above command, you should see your environment variables, as shown in the image below.
